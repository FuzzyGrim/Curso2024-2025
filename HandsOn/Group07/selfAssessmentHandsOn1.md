# Self-Assessment for Hands-on 1

## Group Information:
- **Group Name**: Group06
- **Members**: Juan Sebastian Torres Alvarez, Alberto Aragon Calvo, Rodrigo Allende Rial, Miguel Carrallo

## Evaluation Criteria:
### 1. Dataset Selection:
We successfully selected a dataset from the Smart City domain, fulfilling the requirements of format (CSV), open license, and linkability with real-world entities. The dataset also includes sufficient documentation for further development.

### 2. Transformation into RDF:
The dataset was analyzed and structured into RDF format. We encountered no major issues during the conversion process. The linkage with other datasets is planned for the next phase.

### 3. Application Development:
The application requirements have been clearly defined, and initial work has begun on the backend and frontend structure. We have set up the GitHub repository and uploaded the necessary materials.

### 4. Team Collaboration:
All team members contributed to the assignment. We collaborated effectively using GitHub for version control and Trello for task management.

## Lessons Learned:
- Working with open data requires thorough research to ensure all requirements are met.
- Communication and division of tasks were key to staying on track.

## Next Steps:
- Continue developing the application with a focus on the RDF data model.
- Implement the user interface and integrate it with map services.
